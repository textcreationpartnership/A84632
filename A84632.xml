            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156041:3"/>contrary (as we conceive) to the Lawes of the Land, and tending to the introducing of an arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Wee thinking our ſelves and all the reſt of the Subjects of this County, to bee ſo highly concerned in the proceedings afore mentioned, as without great diſadvantage to us all, we may not be ſilent therein, doe make this our Proteſtation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration before God and the world, that as our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have hitherto beene altogether peaceable, ſo our deſires, intentions and reſolutions are altogether pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and that all our indeavours and labours ſhall onely tend to the ſettlement and continuance of a reall peace (according to the Lawes of the Land) and to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the fractions, and taking away the diſtractions that have moſt unhappily broken the generall unity of the Inhabitants of this County. And that nothing can be more dangerous and deſtructive thereunto then the raiſing and continuing together in a body, ſuch forces of Horſe and foote in this County, as hath been propounded and adviſed, as aforeſaid without conſent and authority of Parliament. We conceiving the advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings thereof to proceed from ſome deſtructive Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, the ends whereof are to imbroyle this Kingdome in ſuch a deluge of warre, as hath already (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der other pretences) ſwallowed up the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,

            <p>And therefore, We further declare that we will not conſent, nor as much as in us lyeth, ſuffer that any ſuch Forces, either Horſe or Foot, be raiſed of the Trayned bands of this County, nor that moneyes be levied for the maintaining thereof, nor that the Armes of any Subjects (other than Popiſh Recuſants) be taken from them, nor will we conſent nor ſuffer (as much as in us lyeth) that any War or Hoſtility be acted in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor any Forraine Forces brought in upon us; and if any ſuch attempts ſhall be offered or made, we will endeavour to reſiſt and ſuppreſſe them, and to keepe the Peace of the County entire, ſo farre as the Antient knowne Lawes of the Land, and the late Declarations and Orders of Parliament, made upon theſe immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Occaſions ſhall inable us therein.</p>
            <p>And we do likewiſe Declare, that we ſhall be moſt ready and willing upon generall Summons given at <hi>Yorke</hi> or any other convenient place to be appointed to meet the reſt of the Gentry and other conſiderable inhabitants of the County to adviſe of ſuch matters as
